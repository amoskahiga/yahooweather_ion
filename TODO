-  Find a way to perform location lookup and validation.  Currently not supported by Yahoo; however, an API to query for this data might be added later as discussed on: <http://developer.yahoo.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=1305>.  For USA users, you can simply use your ZIP code for the location.  For all other cases, you can obtain a valid location ID by:
    Going to http://weather.yahoo.com/
    Type in your city, country and click Go
    Copy the 8 character location ID from the URL on the next page (i.e. for Hong Kong, China it is CHXX0049)
    Use the location ID as the location for the dataengine in the weather applets

- Change to use WeatherUtils::Percent for "Humidity Field"

- Change to use IonInterface::ChanceThunderstormDay for "scattered thunderstorms".  Cannot currently find any icon  files for the associated weather-scattered-storms-day and weather-scattered-storms-night (at least for the oxygen theme: <http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/kdesupport/oxygen-icons/scalable/status/>).
